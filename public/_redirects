# Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing. If you use routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router 
# with browserHistory), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for /abhishek, the development 
# server will respond to localhost:3000/abhishek properly. For ntelify, the solution is to use a _redirects file as documented here
# https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/
